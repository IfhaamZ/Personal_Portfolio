            Hi, I'm Ifhaam â€” a developer, designer, and data enthusiast who
            loves building things that matter. I recently wrapped up my BIT
            degree, majoring in Full-Stack Development and Data Science, a
            combo that lets me bridge the gap between how things look, how they
            work, and how data can make them smarter.
            <br />
            <br />
            On the development side, I build full-stack applications from the
            ground up, frontend, backend, databases, all with an eye for
            clean code and even cleaner UX. I'm big on UI/UX design and product
            thinking, always asking: How does this feel for the user? What
            problem are we solving?
            <br />
            <br />
            At the same time, I'm just as passionate
            about data. I love diving into messy datasets, finding patterns, and
            using machine learning to build smart systems that adapt and
            improve. Whether it's predictive models, dashboards, or data-driven
            features in apps, I enjoy turning insights into real-world impact.
          </p>
